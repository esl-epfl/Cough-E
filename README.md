# Cough-E

Welcome to the repository accompanying the [Cough-E algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24066). 

# Repository structure

The repository contains both C code for deploying the Cough-E algorithm on embedded devices (located in the C_application folder), as well as the methodology infrastructure through which the algorithm was developed (locateed in the ML_methodology folder). Each of these folders contains a README further detailing its structure and usage.
